Material covers, among others, topics such as

- basics of dynamics / oscillations
- frequency analysis
- wave propagation and dispersion
- insights into selected applications and laboratory tests

The notebooks can be viewed with nbviewer, see https://jupyter.org/, or can now also be run interactively using binder (available through nbviewer).
